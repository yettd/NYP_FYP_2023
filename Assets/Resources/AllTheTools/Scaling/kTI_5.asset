    at the appropriate line angles\r\n5. Establish and maintain correct face to tooth
    surface angulation for insertion at 0-40\xB0 for insertion; and scaling at between
    45-80\xB0 \r\n6. Maintain correct adaptation as instrument strokes progress around
    the tooth surface, pivot and roll instrument as needed\r\n7. Constantly maintain
    toe third of the cutting edge to tooth surface\r\n8. Use short controlled calculus
    removal strokes in a coronal direction to remove to remove deposits from tooth
    surface\r\n9. Demonstrate proper root planning strokes, which are lighter, longer
    and shaving strokes when debriding root surface\r\n10. Apply appropriate lateral
    pressure in a coronal direction\r\n11. Maintain a neutral wrist position while
