  Instrumentation: "<b>Instrumentation</b>\r\n1. Insert at line angle, keep the tip
    in contact with the tooth, pressing down to touch the soft tissue base. \r\n2.
    Inititiate a series of short, bobbing strokes(walking stroke) toward the distal
    surface \r\n3. Walk the probe onto the distal surface until it touches the contact
    area \r\n4. Tilt the probe so that the tip reaches beneath  the contact area
    and gently press downward to touch the junctional epithelium \r\n5. Lightly insert
    down against the base of the sulcus and obtain a reading. \r\n6. Reinsert at
    the disto-buccal line angle in preparation for assessing the facial surface \r\n7.
    Make a series of walking strokes, moving in a forward direction toward the mesio-buccal
    line angle \r\n8. Tilt the probe beneath the mesial contact and assess."
