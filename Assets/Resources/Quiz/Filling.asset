  - question: Why is it not advisable to overetch?
    answers:
    - Overetching ensures that you have etched the tooth sufficiently and will improve
      the bond between resin and the tooth
    - Overetching creates more microtags for better retention of material to tooth
    - Overetching creates a stronger bond between resin and the tooth, so you should
      etch longer
    - Overetching causes more demineralization that does not allow the resin to flow
      to the overetched depth, resulting in a weaker bond
    correctAnswer: 4

  - question: Why do we etch the tooth?
    answers:
    - It promotes the bonding between enamel and resin composite restorative material.
    - By decreasing the tooth's surface area and making it smoother, etching gel
      improves the bonding agent's ability to adhere to the tooth.
    - By increasing the tooth's surface area and making it rougher, etching gel improves
      the bonding agent's ability to adhere to the tooth.
    - It helps to remove the dentinal smear layer.

    - Avoid using fissure sealant for patients younger than 8 years old
    - We should place fissure sealant right after polishing.
